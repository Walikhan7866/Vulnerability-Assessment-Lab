 Detailing specific vulnerabilities offers essential insights into their nature and potential impact. This includes examining Plug 
 Details such as Severity, ID, Vulnerability Type, and Family, along with Risk Information like Risk Factor, CVSS v2.0 Base Score, and 
 Vector. Furthermore, understanding the Description of the Vulnerability and its recommended Solution provides crucial guidance for 
 effective remediation strategies.

 The identified vulnerability pertains to the VNC (Virtual Network Computing) server operating on the remote host, characterized by a 
 critical severity level. The vulnerability, assigned ID 61708, stems from the usage of a weak password to secure the VNC server. 
 Nessus successfully authenticated using the default password 'password,' indicating a significant security lapse. This vulnerability 
 poses a severe risk as it enables a remote, unauthenticated attacker to potentially gain control of the system. The recommended 
 solution involves securing the VNC service by implementing a robust, non-default password to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access 
 and potential exploitation.

I ran "ip a" to confirm by cross-referencing the IP address from my virtual machine with the IP address obtained remotely (identical IP addresses).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project underscores the paramount importance of vulnerability scanning in cybersecurity. Through the utilization of advanced tools like the Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, we have acquired crucial insights into identifying and mitigating system weaknesses. The practical application of these tools, including the scanning of vulnerable systems, accentuates the necessity for proactive security measures. These lessons serve as a reminder of the ongoing vigilance required to combat the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats.
